## Engineering Insights

The simulation results provide several engineering insights into electric vehicle behavior under different driving conditions.

### Driver Behavior Impact

Aggressive driving significantly increases battery consumption and leads to a faster drop in State of Charge (SOC).  
Eco driving mode provides the most energy-efficient operation.

### Battery Health Impact

Vehicles with aged batteries experience:

* Reduced maximum speed
* Faster SOC depletion
* Lower overall performance

### Road Slope Impact

Uphill road conditions increase the power demand of the vehicle and reduce the achievable speed compared to flat road scenarios.

### Traffic Resistance Impact

Higher traffic resistance increases energy consumption and reduces driving efficiency.

### Scenario Analysis

The scenario sweep simulation demonstrates how combinations of driver behavior, road conditions, traffic resistance, and battery health influence the overall vehicle performance.

These insights illustrate how simulation models can be used to evaluate vehicle efficiency and support engineering decision-making in electric mobility systems.
